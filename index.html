                    <p>
                            Our game is entitled CrestFallen. CrestFallen is a Rogue-Like 2D game. The goal is to advance from room to room and defeat all enemies spawning in these rooms.
                            The game plays out on 3 different floors. One Boss, a harder-to-defeat enemy with special abilities, waits for the player at the end of each floor. You have to defeat him to chagne floors.
                            The game has a total of 3 difficulties. To help the player, weapons and potions will be dropped by enemies and bosses in their death.
